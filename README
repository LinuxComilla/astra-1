# Astra Exploit Framework #
The Astra Exploit Framework (astra) is a tool for exploit development and
penetration testing, designed for collaboration.

## Team Server and Console Client ##
The team server is a SOAP RPC server. All actual work is done on the server.
This way, it is easier to share objects and operations between users. To that
point, all sockets, objects, file descriptors, etc. are shared. The console
client is a SOAP based terminal for accessing the Team Server.

Note: This release is alpha, and it not even close to a real working example.

Start the client with the following commands:
```bash
python3 astra console
```

### Versioning ###
All version numbers follow PEP-440: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/
